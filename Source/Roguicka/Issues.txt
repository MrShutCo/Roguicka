<Saturday morning>
Right now, in order to check if there is a player standing on an object, it must either be pushed to the Queue
or is executed once you walk off the stairs.

<Later that night>
The code is a mess. I have no clue where to put anything, and I'm just making things worse.

<5 minutes later>
Well god damn, I got level changing working. And it's actually not bad, I tried my best to avoid statics.
I've been thinking about how to change this, since right now there's 3 different places storing the map.
I'm just updating all of them, but I might have to use a static or something. I don't know what 
it is, but I just keep running out of ways to access things.

...Maybe a flowchart would work. We need some general overhead stuff, such as guidelines, so we don't
keep running into problems like this. Im stopping work on it for now, major refactoring might be needed
in the future.

<Sunday morning>
Decided to work on bug fixes. For some reason, NeededEnergy isn't loading up, so all monsters can move right away
lol what. I changed the constructor in stats for their lowercase proper form, and it worked. That was some weird JSONConvert
stuff going on there.

Bugs:
	Sometimes monsters dont move at all
	Slow enemy on corpse yields lots of loot from corpse when attacked

Fixed:
	Player no longer moves around while dead
	Enemies don't spam kill you when you're dead
	Energy is now loading up fom JSON (speed returned)
	Hero no longer attacks dead bodies

Other:
	Need to balance out stats. Hero is way too OP
	Attacking now shows the actual enemy that attacked you
	Better level-up info
